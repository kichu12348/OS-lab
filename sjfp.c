    shortest job first pre-emptive

    1. The process with the smallest execution time is selected for execution.
    2. If two processes have the same execution time, the process that arrived first is selected.
    3. The process that arrives first, gets added to the queue first, and runs first.
    4. The process that arrives next, gets added to the queue next, and runs next.
    5. The process that arrives last, gets added to the queue last, and runs last.
     this is pre-emptive
    i will use an array of structs called process
    each struct will have an id, arrival time, burst time, waiting time, and turnaround time and completed default 0 ie false
    i will sort the array of structs by burst time
    then i will calculate the waiting time and turnaround time for each process
