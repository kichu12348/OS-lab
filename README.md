# 🦇 THE BAT-OS LABORATORY 🦇

*"It's not who I am underneath the code, but what my algorithms do that defines me."*

## Welcome to the Batcave's Secret OS Lab Repository!

I'm **Kichu** (aka BETMEN), patrolling the dark streets of Operating Systems, fighting against deadlocks, race conditions, and inefficient disk seeks! This repository documents my never-ending battle against chaos in computing systems.

## 🦇 JUSTICE FOR ALL PROCESSES 🦇

### 💾 Disk Scheduling Algorithms
- **FCFS**: First-Come, First-Served - As fair as Betmen's moral code
- **SCAN**: Like how I sweep the streets of Gotham
- **C-SCAN**: For when criminals try to hide at the disk boundaries

### ⛓️ Deadlock Management
- **Banker's Algorithm**: Even Batman has to manage resources wisely
- **Deadlock Detection**: Finding villains trapped in their own circular schemes

### 📄 Page Replacement Algorithms
- **FIFO**: The oldest pages must retire, like the first Batman movie
- **LRU**: Least Recently Used, like my backup Batsuits
- **LFU**: Some bat-gadgets just don't see enough action

### 🔄 Process Synchronization
- **Producer-Consumer**: Alfred (producer) making gadgets for Batman (consumer)
- **Readers-Writers**: Because sometimes Robin needs to read the Batcomputer while I'm updating it

## 💻 How To Execute Bat-Code

```bash
# Compile with gcc
gcc <filename>.c -o <output>

# For pthread programs
gcc <filename>.c -o <output> -lpthread

# Run the executable
./<output>
```

## 🦇 REMEMBER

With great computing power comes great responsibility.
My OS algorithms might be the algorithms Gotham deserves, but not the ones it needs right now.

## 📊 Memory Leaks

What's more terrifying than the Joker? MEMORY LEAKS and RACE CONDITIONS!
